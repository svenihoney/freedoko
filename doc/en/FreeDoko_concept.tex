\section{Game Idea}
The game Doppelkopf is a card game for four or more players.
One game is played by four players. the game Doppelkopf has is origin in game Schafkopf,
which is mostly played in south germany.
The name of this game seems to depend on the double(german:doppel) occuring of all cards (Doppel-Scahfkopf).
Doppelkopf is played in opposite to Schafkopf in the whole of germany, but mainly in northh germany and
the region of Rhein and Main.\\
Doppelkopf is a card game with 48 cards and a minimum of 4 players, that is not so different from Skat.
It is played with two normal sets of Skat cards without the cards seven and eight. Most of the time the owners of the club queens
are playing together. By this you get while playing often new pairs of players.
In the beginning of each game it is unknown which players are in the same team.
To find this out or to hide it, is one of main attractions of the game Doppelkopf.\\
For Doppelkopf the skills of each players are one great factor for the course of the game.
This guarantees an exciting and varied game event.

\begin{itemize}
\item for each trick
\begin{itemize}
\item determine who plays next
\item waiting for next card

\end{itemize}
\item collecting trick

\end{itemize}
\item end of game
\begin{itemize}
\item counting of points

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Server}

\item dealing of cards
\item management of rules
\item management of players points
\item communication with clients
\item choosing type of client (human, ai)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Client}
\begin{itemize}
\item Setting of players name
\item looking at the last trick
\item gets rules from server
\item checking for rule violations
\item gets played cards from server
\item plays cards
\end{itemize}
\subsection{peer-to-peer}
Each computer knows all other computers which are part of this game.
Each computer knows the actual server.\\
loss of server:
If one client doesn't get a message for more than 0.3 sec from the server, he ask the server if he is still alive.
If he gets no answer from the server, sends a loss of server to all other computers.
At the start each computer gets an identifier (number) and now the computer with lowest identifier is the new server.

\section{Ai}
\subsection{Functions}
\begin{itemize}
\item chooseable difficult level
\begin{itemize}
\item memory
\item foresight
\item counting of cards
\end{itemize}
\item chooseable behaviour
